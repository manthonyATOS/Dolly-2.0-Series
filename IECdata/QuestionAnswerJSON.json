We supported all aspects of implementation from creating the data sharing processes for the hostile environment, input to business case and overall strategy.  Atos input provided techniques and insight to the Leadership to create evidence based recommendations.","127":"We don\u2019t just design solutions; we deliver and manage the change surrounding their implementation, making us uniquely qualified as the ideal end-to-end partner for programmes such as this.  On the Immigration Act Health Surcharge, we influenced the overall solution by reviewing the economic assumptions to ensure the level of charging applied was correct, and enabling different policy rules to be set within the legal framework.  We introduced the concept of agile methodologies to the delivery team, and defined the overall target operating model for the new charging processes.  These were accepted by the delivery teams which had to operate these.","128":"On the Immigration Act we initially worked with Interventions and Sanctions to define the outcomes required, then identified the cross departmental governance regimes necessary \u2013 teams in each department, objectives, and ways of working collaboratively.   Subsequently we worked within the Home Office to define the governance of the Health Surcharge Team \u2013 a structure that included appropriate representation from policy, legal, procurement and business units and other change programmes.   This was important given the agile nature of the development required.  The Health Surcharge was the first successful agile delivery of Government legislation in the Home Office.","129":"Atos has a clear understanding of end-to-end processes, core infrastructure and applications gained through our work across police forces, Home Office, and secure government agencies.\n\nAt CCD, one example of our understanding was exploring the concept of the request filter and broker service with investigators to produce a working demonstration of how the service might operate bringing out some transformational ideas.  We facilitated workshops to look at the core processes for communications data workflow to consider potential improvements in the exploitation of communications data.  This provided us with unique insight in to the core infrastructure and processes which currently exist.","130":"Typical challenges include multiple conflicting priorities, different police forces with localised requirements; multiple suppliers; overcoming resistance to change (e.g. technical\/operational\/contractual reasons); within a highly legislative\/secure environment. \n\nWithin the initial Optica project, challenges included data segregation between multiple forces sharing the same system to manage the CD workflow process. \n\nAtos worked collaboratively with five different forces\/organisations to agree a strong technical strategy. The key risk was ensuring data segregation at all levels.  We implemented mitigation actions such as the segregation of system tenants, providing the necessary level of assurance that data was adequately separated, whilst maintaining benefits of a centralised\/shared system.\n","131":"Supporting CCD, Atos\u2019 partner Roke provided support to the Bill team during production of the draft through to Royal Assent, giving a broad understanding of the provisions across CD, LI and EI.

It relied on the ability to access the inbuilt sensors of a user\u2019s mobile smartphone and needed to partner the website which analytics showed was accessed mainly by iOS devices. The user centred design approach needed to ensure that the app was easy to use, attractive and encouraging for the target audience who were in their over 50s an \u2018non-tech\u2019 users.  As a result it was decided to invest the money in a native iOS development rather than a cross-platform solution which, although reaching a wider audience, could potentially have a reduced usability.   \n\u2022 We designed and developed a Junior ISA product for NS&I; the user-centric design process needed to be balanced against business (predominantly compliance) and technology considerations, particularly legacy IT and the need to deliver a solution that was compatible with existing, somewhat constrained, IT systems. \n\u2022 In partnership with HMRC and NS&I we designed and are about to launch a user friendly childcare portal to help working parents with the cost of childcare. This is the first \u2018Digital by Default\u2019 service from HMRC, which needed to adhere to a strict set of user-centric design criteria in order to maximise take-up and contribute to the government\u2019s digital targets.\n","185":"The Government\u2019s Digital Design Principles and Digital Service Standard have been incorporated into the Atos Agile by Default Methodology. These have been used on many citizen facing projects for example:\n\n\u2022 At Skills Funding Agency, the Customer Data Service was delivered using this methodology as SFA were keen to explicitly acknowledge the Governments Digital by Default standard.\n\u2022 At Glasgow City Council, we adapted this methodology to produce a version that combined these standards with the Council\u2019s approval gates and governance processes. \n\u2022 The NS&I Tax Free Childcare Programme have developed the Childcare Provider and Parental Application Portals to GDS Standards. We have developed through the GDS Phases (Discovery\/Alpha\/Beta etc) and have experience presenting the Service Standards at GDS reviews at each stage.\n\nWe work closely with our customers to ensure we follow the Design Principles to build services based on user needs and iterating to ensure consistency.\n\nAtos also uses the GDS templates (govuk_template-master, govuk_elements-master, and govuk_frontend_toolkit-master) on several Digital Prototyping projects and have a standard build system that creates web applications using these templates. We have a server \u201cstack\u201d based on open source technologies and the user experience is configured to use these templates.\n\nAdditionally, our partner Health Intelligence has built several software systems over the past two decades for the NHS, ensuring all relevant government \/NHS standards are met and compliance maintained. For example, Spectra PM is a fully integrated diabetic eye screening browser-based software solution.  It meets all Common Assurance Process requirements specified by the English National Diabetic Eye Screening Programme.","186":"Atos has demonstrable experience integrating systems via APIs with a number of customers.\n\nAtos\u2019 \u201cDigital Connect\u201d SaaS offering enables machine-machine communication for Government.

These 7 teams successfully delivered in excess of 50 epics, with synchronised releases across 5 different delivery tracks.  We did this by using process automation, transparent and visual project management together with a smooth collaboration framework for planning and daily meetings aided by communication tools. We also implemented continuous integration and deployment to ensure seamless delivery.","189":"Atos was asked to build an application which enables clinical and non-clinical learners to take e-learning courses. The goal was to replace an existing system which has not offered sufficient features. Because requirements were too general, the team did an extended discovery phase and created an eLearning platform, which also provides management of training schedules, monitoring of learners\u2019 progress and certificate generation. Daily sessions with the key stakeholder let the team refine missing requirements and make sure that current work helps to meet the client\u2019s needs. The application devleopment is ongoing and the client\u2019s feedback is positive and enthusiastic","190":"The MOD Defence Business Services (DBS) is transformaing its remaining paper-based services and invited suppliers to produce an application that complied with the Digital by Default Service Standards. Atos worked closely with the DBS including an in-house user researcher to evaluate the user requirements and rapidly iterate a series of prototypes with direct user testing and feedback at each step. The appication progressed quickly, from low-fidelity wireframes to a fully coded applcation using the GDS Node.js framework, the GOV.UK Notify service and publilshed to GOV.UK PaaS. User response has been excellent across a wide spectrum of digital skill levels.","191":"In November 2016, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) engaged Atos to support a large systems engineering programme (\u00a31bn+) in evaluating the applicability of Agile.  Atos trained 30 senior managers (who had no agile experience) and ran a four month Agile programme to understand agile (sprint 1), evaluate the applicability of agile (sprint 2) and then plan (sprint 3) and implement (sprint 4) agile across two of nine workstreams.  The programme continues to use agile successfully and remains on track to meet its objectives.","192":"The MOD DBS provides a number of paper-based services and invited suppliers to produce an application following the Digital by Default Service Standards. Atos created an application following the GOV.UK GDS design principles and successfully and delivered a fully working prototype onto GOV.UK PaaS.

The MOD DBS is looking to move the appication into Alpha and apply the same approach for other non-digital services.","193":"The MOJ invited Atos to evaluate the effectiveness of providing court ushers with an application to enhance the efficiency of courts. The team had 6 weeks to create a production grade proof on concept.  Working with Leeds Magistrates court ushers, the team iterated through several designs. This helped the team  understand the operational benefits of features such as visibility of schedule changes by other ushers and the ability to dynamically re-prioritise cases to maximise the use of courts.  It was the user led approach that led to the definition of these benefits, which were not anticipated during early analysis. ","194":"Atos worked with NHS Scotland to provide their first app in the Apple Store. The app would be a partner to Living it Up website and must make use of the secutiry platform for storing health related patient data (via iOS and the FHIR). The team used the in-built step tracking to engage users socially and encourage the contribution of their steps towards community challenges. NHS Scotland were genuinely delighted with their first entry in to the Apple app store. Step it Up has been nominated for the Digital Leaders 100 category of Mobile Innovation of the Year 2017.","195":"Working at NS&I, Atos introduced a WebOps team that established a faster deployment cycle to NS&I\u2019s web channels and introduced AB testing capability. The team had to navigate and map existing complex development, governance and deployment processes. These processes were deeply embedded across both NS&I and Atos as their IT partner and also involved interactions with multiple third parties for design and development services.

The Product Manager from HMCTS guided the development and acted as Product Owner.  The project was run using agile with weekly sprints.  Designers were key to the project as it needed to operate in courts running on iPads in a way that made sense for Court Ushers.  For example, a key feature for Court Ushers was near real time updates of the court schedules as any of the 20 or so ushers made updates.  These design features were implemented in weekly sprints with show and tells each week.  Testing with Court Ushers was undertaken in Leeds Magistrates Court to enhance usability for example, in the use of colour to highlight updates.

The gaps between the current data and the required future strategic business data were highlighted. \n","1325":"A major utility organisation needed to ensure its data-assets supported business operations and complied with legislation.\n\nAtos designed and implemented Data Governance processes\/policies\/standards to ensure optimal quality of corporate data-assets. Roles and responsibilities were assigned in-line with an agreed RACI matrix (e.g. data-owners\/data-stewards). Communication channels were developed to ensure processes\/data-standards are followed to maintain governance. E.g. for GDPR, we implemented privacy-by-design, which requires communication with data-owners; gaining permissions and using anonymisation\/pseudo-anonymisation where necessary. \n\nWe communicated the existence, quality, ownership, and sensitivity of data while increasing security of data-handling operations.

Atos propose that the CDC service is configured with a requirement-specific \u201cintegration route\u201d between DWP (the consumer) and the NHS data API\u2019s (the provider), thereby allowing the DWP PoC project to focus on the evaluation of the data available from NHS, rather than on the construction of an integration service from the ground up.\n","1327":"The proposed CDC service is configurable as an event broker (between event creators and event consumers) in an event-driven architecture, and it is also configurable as a broker between a consumer and provider(s) of micro-services. CDC supports multiple industry standard, platform-agnostic (micro-service and API) protocols and messaging protocols, such as JMS, TLS, MQTT, Stomp, AMQP, AJAX, REST+JSON, SOAP, WSDL, JAX-WS, WS-Security and WS-Reliable Messaging.\n\n","1328":"Atos has considerable experience in delivering Digital Services to the GDS codes of practice with DWP, NS&I and HMCTS, employing the Agile delivery methodology to yield time-boxed iterative releases.\nBy using an existing SaaS integration service, the DWP project can quickly deliver a Minimum Viable Product (Alpha service) capable of use by a subset of Healthcare Professionals. The project can define measurable success criteria in terms of the ability to match the DWP customer to his\/her NHS patient records, and crucially, the viability of that data in circumventing the otherwise clerical request for Further Medical Evidence from the customer\u2019s GP.\n","1329":"DWP already employ the CDC service for brokering housing-benefit related transactions from DWP to 382 Local Authorities.\nThe DWP (housing-benefit) use case of CDC employs a PAMM stack (Play\/AngularJS\/Mongo\/MySQL), and has been adapted to include a user upload\/download interface which in turn comprises HTM5\/CSS for the user interface with Spring Boot\/Java 8 providing enterprise grade back-end services using SOAP calls and RESTful APIs.\n","1330":"DWP already employ the CDC service for brokering housing-benefit related transactions from DWP to 382 Local Authorities.\nThe DWP (housing-benefit) use case of CDC employs a PAMM stack (Play\/AngularJS\/Mongo\/MySQL), and has been adapted to include a user upload\/download interface which in turn comprises HTM5\/CSS for the user interface with Spring Boot\/Java 8 providing enterprise grade back-end services using SOAP calls and RESTful APIs.\n","1331":"The solution can readily be deployed to the Health AWS Cloud platform. Atos can implement secure access to the AWS hosted service to provide a Service Support (service wrap) function if required by DWP.","1332":"The CDC service is offered via the Digital Marketplace as a configurable consumption-based SaaS. Although it is built from open technologies, it does employ third party products (RedHat). Given that customers such as DWP pay on a consumption basis, the underlying application platform costs (including third party software licencing) are abstracted from the customer.
